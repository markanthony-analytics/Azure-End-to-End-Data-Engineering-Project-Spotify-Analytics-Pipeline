# Azure-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project-Spotify-Analytics-Pipeline

# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end modern data engineering pipeline on Azure using Spotify streaming data.
The goal is to ingest raw files from Azure Storage, perform data cleaning & transformations using Spark in Azure Databricks, and create curated analytics tables for downstream reporting & trend insights.

The solution mirrors how data engineering pipelines are built in real-world cloud environments—scalable, fault-tolerant, and analytics-ready.
